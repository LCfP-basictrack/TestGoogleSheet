# Assignment 3 - Variables

Create a file called `interest.py`, it should have variables for the starting amount, the interest per year and the number of years. Print the amount in a bank account that starts with &euro; 10.000,00 earning 1.5% per year after 10 years.

Note: this should obviously be calculated using the values in the variables. Look up "compound interest" if you don't remember the formula.
